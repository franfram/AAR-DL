stuff to keep in mind

-   Train, validation and test data:

how do we do the splits? add jeremy howards stuff here and then decide (e.g., different sheeps? same sheep different time?)

-   overfitting due to information leakeage during data wrangling.

Warning\
Risk of data leak Do not use minmax_scale unless you know what you are doing. A common mistake is to apply it to the entire data before splitting into training and test sets. This will bias the model evaluation because information would have leaked from the test set to the training set. In general, we recommend using MinMaxScaler within a Pipeline in order to prevent most risks of data leaking: pipe = make_pipeline(MinMaxScaler(), LogisticRegression()).
